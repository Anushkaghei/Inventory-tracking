## ABSTRACT

The aim of this project is to develop a system to track any kitchen inventory by sending a live video feed monitoring the quantity of food in each container, to a client using socket programming. The system consists of a camera, a server, and a client.  

The server accesses the camera, and is responsible for processing the video to detect the level of food stored in a container.
The client, which can be accessed remotely, connects to the server and receives the inventory information in real-time. 
This allows the client to monitor the inventory and receive alerts when certain items are running low. The system is designed to be scalable and can be easily modified to include additional cameras or inventory locations. 

The use of socket programming ensures that the system is responsive and can handle multiple clients simultaneously. The implementation of this system has the potential to save time and reduce waste by ensuring that the kitchen inventory is well-managed and properly tracked.
